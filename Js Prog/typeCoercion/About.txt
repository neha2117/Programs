What is type Coercion?
Conversion from one type to another in Js is called Coercion.

Types of Coercion
1. Implicit
2. Explicit

Implicit: The conversion which is done by Js itself while executing a program.
Eg: let a = 20
    let b = a + ""
    console.log(a); // 20
    console.log(b) // "20"
    Here Js implicitly converts the type of 20 into "20", that's why it is called implicit Coercion.

Explicit: The conversion which is made explicitly in code to convert the type.
Eg: let x = "10"
    let y = Number(10);
    console.log(x);
    y will become Numeric 10 else x was "10".

Note:  The type of y is explicitly converted, that's why it is called explicit Coercion.



Note: "==" this equility does the implicit coercion to compare the values but
      "===" doesn't alloes Js to do implicit coercion.
