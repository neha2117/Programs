Implement a Queue Data Structure specifically to store integer data using a Singly Linked List.
The data members should be private.

You need to implement the following public functions :
1. Constructor:
It initialises the data members as required.

2. enqueue(data) :
This function should take one argument of type integer. It enqueues the element into the queue and returns nothing.

3. dequeue() :
It dequeues/removes the element from the front of the queue and in turn, returns the element being dequeued or removed. In case the queue is empty, it returns -1.

4. front() :
It returns the element being kept at the front of the queue. In case the queue is empty, it returns -1.

5. getSize() :
It returns the size of the queue at any given instance of time.

6. isEmpty() :
It returns a boolean value indicating whether the queue is empty or not.
